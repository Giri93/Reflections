What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository helps in making a directory to a git repository so that the history of each commit to that repository can be tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is the stage of a repository before commit. Staging area allows us to add desired num of files to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By using the git diff --staged we can get to know the differences between the staging area and the latest commit.
