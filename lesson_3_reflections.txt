When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I work on the same repository from different computers and when we as a team working on a project using a repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This helps in including only the changes we feel necessary to be present in the local repository to be pulled rather than updating the local with every small change made to the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I will use Forks - when I want to make changes to someones repsitory and i dont have permissions to edit that or I want to add changes to that in my own repository.
Clones - when I want to have a local repository of a repository that is not in my computer.
Branches - when I want to try some experiments/changes and dont want the changes to effect the other branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This helps Git in deciding whether the next pull should be a fast forward merge or a normal merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
By talking directly or through email. Using Github would be easier than the other as it will have all the information about the required in it.
